 * Now we allow people to write their answers in a file, say, 'answers.txt'
 * How do we tell them if their answers are the correct ones?
 *
 * What do you do when you get an IOException?
 * What about in the instance-based version?
 *
 * Consider:
 * Composition
 * Inheritance
 * Editing of the original
 * Ease of adding answers
 *
 * Copy this class into the 'correctinstanceversion' package and try there too.
